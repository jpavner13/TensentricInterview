# TensentricInterview
This repository contains the code for my solution to the Tensentric Internship coding problem for a summer 2023 internship.

I made a few adjustments, assumptions, and improvements to the reccomended path of solving this problem based on the given information. I'm looking forward to discussing them with you on Tuesday, January 24th!

Although my solution is not nessicarily the easiest way to go about solving this problem, I wanted to use this opportunity to show off some of my skills including object oriented programming (classes, instances, etc.), data structures, algorithms, pointers, vectors, matricies, command line control and shells, array manipulation, optimization based on physical constraints, string manipulation, refrences, random testing, and abstraction. 

I wrote this program in c++ since that is the language that Tensentric generally uses. To compile the program, run:

'g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Puck.cpp Hungarian.cpp -o run'

...and to run the program, run:

'./run'
